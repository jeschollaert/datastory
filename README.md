# Reactionary Twitter Politics

## Why
For this project, I chose to explore the reactionary responses to comedian Michelle Wolf's performance at the 2018 White House Correspondent's Dinner. The host's role at the annual Correspondent's Dinner is difficult in that it requires striking a balance of tone- how to roast the journalists and politicians in the room and appeal to a wider audience, as the performance is streamed live? Wolf's job was particularly difficult, given the fact that the current president does not attend the dinners, and has routinely skewered journalists online in countless offensive and incendiary Twitter rants. Wolf, then, was faced with the same choice that all citizens face, but on a much more visible platform: to treat the administration lightly, and fall complicit in inaction, or to call out the horrors of the administration and face the attendant outrage machine. Wolf chose the latter, and, as has become the norm lately, Twitter became the outrage machine's medium (weapon?) of choice.

## How
I gathered two data sets in an attempt to track the reaction time of the outrage machine. I set the parameters of my twarc search to include only tweets sent to Michelle Wolf's account (@michelleisawolf) that included #WHCD in the message. My first set was for the time window of April 28th (the day of the dinner) to April 29th, and my second set was from April 28th to April 30th. The first set included only four tweets, all of which expressed excitement and enthusiasm. The second set is considerably more expansive, including 3,285 tweets. For the purposes of this exercise, my data story will consider the more generative results from the longer, second timeframe. My goal in designing the search this way was to explore the ways in which the Twitter community utilized the direct address of tweeting at Michelle Wolf to express their opinions - be they positive or negative - about her remarks. How does the direct address change the reactionary politics of twitter? And what do I gain as a researcher in utilizing search parameters that do not engage with the nuances of subtweeting?
